# Intercloud networking test

- Please see [my code](https://github.com/doitintl/intercloud-throughput) that
  tests  throughput and latency within and between regions in the same or different clouds.

- See also the [related article](https://www.doit-intl.com/throughput-metrics-across-the-clouds/)

- What makes this different

  Other cloud performance test benchmarks are available, but

  * Most focus on latency, not throughput
  * Most are in a single cloud.
  * This compares throughput to distance.
